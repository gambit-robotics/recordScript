💡 Key Insights:
   • Average confidence: 85.8%
   • High average confidence indicates good model certainty
   • Average motion similarity: 83.2%
   • 1 detections with low motion similarity (<75%)
   • Average analysis time: 4.3s
   • Slow analysis times - consider optimizing model inference
   • Food manipulation ratio (add/remove): 1.00
   • Missing critical actions: remove-pan

📝 Recommendations:
   • Set confidence threshold around 75-80% to filter noise
   • Consider raising motion similarity threshold to reduce false triggers
   • Optimize model inference speed (current avg: 4.3s)
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Low detection rate - consider lowering confidence threshold
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
