💡 Key Insights:
   • Acceptance rate: 75.0% (18/24 detections)
   • Average confidence: 79.0%
   • Accepted avg: 79.7%, Rejected avg: 77.0%
   • Confidence gap (accepted - rejected): 2.7%
   • Small confidence gap suggests threshold may be too close to average
   • Moderate confidence - consider threshold tuning
   • 1 low-confidence detections may be false positives
   • Rejection range: 75.0% - 78.0%
   • 2 rejections close to threshold (±5%)
   • Missing critical actions: add-pan, remove-pan, remove-food

📝 Recommendations:
   • Current threshold analysis:
     - Highest rejected: 78.0%
     - Average rejected: 77.0%
     - Lowest rejected: 75.0%
     - Threshold may be too high (only 1.7% gap)
     - Suggested threshold: 83.0%
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Low detection rate - consider lowering confidence threshold
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
