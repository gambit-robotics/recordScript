💡 Key Insights:
   • Average confidence: 84.0%
   • Moderate confidence - consider threshold tuning
   • Missing critical actions: add-pan, remove-pan, remove-food

📝 Recommendations:
   • Set confidence threshold around 75-80% to filter noise
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
