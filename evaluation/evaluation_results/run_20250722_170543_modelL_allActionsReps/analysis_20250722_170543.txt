💡 Key Insights:
   • Average confidence: 84.4%
   • Moderate confidence - consider threshold tuning
   • Food manipulation ratio (add/remove): 4.00

📝 Recommendations:
   • Set confidence threshold around 75-80% to filter noise
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Low detection rate - consider lowering confidence threshold
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
