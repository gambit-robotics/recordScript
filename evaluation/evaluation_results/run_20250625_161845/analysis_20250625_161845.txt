💡 Key Insights:
   • Acceptance rate: 75.0% (9/12 detections)
   • Average confidence: 77.8%
   • Accepted avg: 79.6%, Rejected avg: 72.7%
   • Moderate confidence - consider threshold tuning
   • 1 low-confidence detections may be false positives
   • Average motion similarity: 85.7%
   • Average analysis time: 6.0s
   • 6 slow analyses (>5s) may indicate processing bottlenecks
   • Slow analysis times - consider optimizing model inference
   • Missing critical actions: add-pan, remove-pan, add-food, remove-food

📝 Recommendations:
   • Current threshold appears effective (highest rejected: 75.0%)
   • Optimize model inference speed (current avg: 6.0s)
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Low detection rate - consider lowering confidence threshold
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
