💡 Key Insights:
   • Average confidence: 85.0%
   • High average confidence indicates good model certainty
   • Average motion similarity: 87.0%
   • Average analysis time: 4.2s
   • Slow analysis times - consider optimizing model inference
   • Food manipulation ratio (add/remove): 1.00
   • Missing critical actions: add-pan, remove-pan

📝 Recommendations:
   • Set confidence threshold around 75-80% to filter noise
   • Optimize model inference speed (current avg: 4.2s)
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Low detection rate - consider lowering confidence threshold
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
