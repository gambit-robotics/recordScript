💡 Key Insights:
   • Average confidence: 77.8%
   • Moderate confidence - consider threshold tuning
   • Average motion similarity: 85.1%
   • Average analysis time: 6.8s
   • 15 slow analyses (>5s) may indicate processing bottlenecks
   • Slow analysis times - consider optimizing model inference
   • Missing critical actions: add-pan, remove-pan, remove-food

📝 Recommendations:
   • Set confidence threshold around 65-70% to avoid missing actions
   • Optimize model inference speed (current avg: 6.8s)
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
