💡 Key Insights:
   • Average confidence: 81.5%
   • Moderate confidence - consider threshold tuning
   • Average motion similarity: 84.9%
   • Average analysis time: 8.8s
   • 2 slow analyses (>5s) may indicate processing bottlenecks
   • Slow analysis times - consider optimizing model inference
   • Missing critical actions: add-pan, remove-pan, add-food

📝 Recommendations:
   • Set confidence threshold around 75-80% to filter noise
   • Consider raising motion similarity threshold to reduce false triggers
   • Optimize model inference speed (current avg: 8.8s)
   • Implement temporal smoothing to reduce duplicate detections
   • Add action sequence validation (logical flow checking)
   • Low detection rate - consider lowering confidence threshold
   • Review video manually to validate detection timing accuracy
